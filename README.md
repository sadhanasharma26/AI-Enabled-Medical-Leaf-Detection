# AI Enabled Medical Leaf Detection
Built an "AI enabled system for determination of medicinal leaf properties", which would detect the leaf and check if it has medicinal advantages/properties based on our provided dataset and then give the output for the particular cure of disease it can used for. Shows its virtues and how to use it for treating a particular disease. 
We've divided the project in two parts for two semesters:

  * Part 1 : <br/>
  We've completed the leaf processing and its feature extraction by using medicial leaf dataset avaialable on kaggle.
  
  * Part 2: <br/>
  In next semester, we'll deploy the model and configure the properties of leaves according to their medicinal advantages. Plus, we'll build a GUI platform 
  to showcase the configured properties and cure.
